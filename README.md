# pick-a-pal

This application is a Tinder for pet adoption where a user can swipe through pets and decide which one they would want. Just making pet adoptions a little more fun than staring at a super long list of dogs. This app was made with HTML, CSS, Materialize, PetFinder API, JQuery, and Javascript.

This was our first group project where I was on the backend team working with JavaScript, JQuery, and the PetFinder API.
