## Summary

This application is like a Tinder for pet adoption where users can swipe through pets and decide which one they would want. This application utilizes PetFinder API to pull the animalâ€™s information and was made with HTML, CSS, Materialize, JQuery, and JavaScript. 

This was my first group project ever. I was on the backend team working with JavaScript, JQuery, and the PetFinder API.

### The Why Adopt Page
