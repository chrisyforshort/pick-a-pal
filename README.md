## Summary

This application is a Tinder for pet adoption where a user can swipe through pets and decide which one they would want. Just making pet adoptions a little more fun than staring at a super long list of dogs. This app was made with HTML, CSS, Materialize, PetFinder API, JQuery, and Javascript.

This was our first group project where I was on the backend team working with JavaScript, JQuery, and the PetFinder API.

### The Why Adopt Page

This page has a slide show where you can see different pictures. 

The screenshot seemed to have a glitch due to the effects of the parallax or the slide show.
